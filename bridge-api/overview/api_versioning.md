Tedee Bridge API is versioned, which allows us to develop and provide new functionalities while keeping backwards compatibility. This ensures that even when a breaking change happens, other services will still be able to work with the API the same way they did.  


## Usage

Each request requires the version number to be provided in the url using this format.  
``http://{bridge IP}/{version}/{resource}``  
For example:  
``http://192.168.1.25/v1.0/lock``  

## Version supported features

To verify which versions provide the feature that you want to utilize, we recommend to visit the **Bridge API Swagger documentation** which is available directly from your Tedee Bridge, simply by entering local IP address (of the Bridge) or using the "Try it now" button in the mobile app.

You should be able to select a version on the left side and check if the desired endpoint is available and how the request body should look like.

### NOTE!
We recommend to upgrade to the latest available version of the API as soon as possible. We do not guarantee how long older versions will be available.
